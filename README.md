# 🚀 TIRE: Data-Centric Relation Extraction for Cyber Threat Intelligence

🔐 **TIRE** (**T**hreat **I**ntelligence **R**elation **E**xtraction) is a **data-centric framework** for high-precision relation extraction (RE) in cybersecurity.  
Instead of increasing architectural complexity, TIRE demonstrates that **better data representations + task design outperform heavier models**, achieving **state-of-the-art accuracy with lower computational cost**.

📌 This repository provides a **reference implementation** of the TIRE framework and sample experiments to support reproducibility and adoption.

🎯 Why TIRE?
Most RE systems are model-centric:

deeper architectures

attention stacking

higher latency

marginal gains

💡 TIRE flips the paradigm by showing that:

Well-engineered data representations + entity-aware masking + lightweight classifiers outperform complex neural architectures.

🧠 Key Idea: Data-Centric vs Model-Centric RE
❌ Model-Centric RE (Traditional)
Complex architectures (CNNs, BiLSTMs, CRFs, Attention stacks)

Long training and inference time

Hard to deploy in real-time CTI pipelines

✅ Data-Centric RE (TIRE)
Entity-aware masking and pooling

Explicit entity type embeddings

Simple dense classifiers

Faster, more explainable, more accurate

🏗️ TIRE Architecture
🧩 Core Components

Pretrained Language Model (BERT / RoBERTa / SecureBERT / SecureBERT⁺)

Entity Mask Pooling

Entity Type Embeddings

Lightweight RE Dense Layer

📌 The model focuses learning only on relevant entity spans, eliminating noise and redundancy.
